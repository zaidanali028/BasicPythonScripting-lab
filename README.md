# BasicPythonScriptingLab

This repository contains a Python script that fulfills the objectives of a basic scripting lab, focusing on essential modules for file handling and requests. The script performs directory creation, file downloading, content modification, and timestamping.

## Lab Objectives
At the end of this lab, I was able to know how to:
- Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies.
- Use Python's `os` module to handle directories.
- Download files from the web using the `requests` module.
- Modify file content and append the current date and time.
